## Data Mining vs Data Warehousing

| **Attribute** | **Data Mining** | **Data Warehouse** |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Process** | Analyzing unknown patterns of data. | Database system designed for analytical instead of transactional work. |
| **Method** | Comparing large amounts of data to find patterns. | Centralizing data from different sources into one common repository. |
| **Users** | Usually done by business users with assistance of engineers. | Occurs before any data mining can take place. |
| **Purpose** | Extracting data from large data sets. | Pooling all relevant data together. |
| **Benefits** | Detection and identification of errors in the system. | Consistent updates; ideal for business owners seeking the latest features. |
| **Applications** | Creating suggestive patterns of important factors like buying habits, products, sales. | Adds value to operational business systems like CRM systems. |
| **Accuracy** | Techniques are never 100% accurate and may have serious consequences. | Data required for analysis may not be integrated, leading to loss of information. |
| **Misuse** | Information gathered can be misused against a group of people. | High maintenance system impacting revenue of medium to small-scale organizations. |
| **Workload** | Complicated queries increase workload. | Complicated to implement and maintain. |
| **Analytical Tool** | Equips organizations with pertinent and usable knowledge-based information. | Stores a large amount of historical data for analyzing different time periods and trends. |
| **Resources** | Requires significant resources for training and implementation. | Data pooled from multiple sources needs to be cleaned and transformed, which is challenging. |
| **Cost-Effectiveness** | Cost-effective and efficient compared to other statistical data applications. | Simplifies business data; users primarily input raw data. |
| **Error Identification** | Identifies errors that can lead to losses. | Allows access to critical data from multiple sources in one place, saving retrieval time. |
| **Actionable Strategies** | Helps generate actionable strategies built on data insights. | Once data is input, it's easy to retrieve and unlikely to be lost. |
