# CASE TOOLS

<!-- TOC --><a name="introduction"></a>
## Introduction

Software Engineering is associated with developing quality software using standards and guidelines. Software is the most expensive item in a computer system, costing more than 95% of the total cost (including hardware). Given the extensive data collection and information generation required, automating software engineering tasks using CASE (Computer Aided Software Engineering) tools is beneficial. CASE tools support various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
