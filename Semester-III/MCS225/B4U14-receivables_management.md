## Credit Evaluation

One of the important elements of credit management is the assessment of the credit risk of the customer. While assessing risk, two types of errors occur:

- **Type 1 error**: Good customers are misclassified as poor credit risks.
- **Type 2 error**: Bad customers are misclassified as good credit risks.

Both errors are costly:
- Type 1 error leads to loss of profit on sales and loss of good customers.
- Type 2 error leads to bad debts and associated costs.

A proper credit evaluation process can reduce these errors. The credit evaluation process involves the following steps:

1. Credit information
2. Credit investigation
3. Credit limits
4. Collection policy

### Credit Information

To ensure that receivables are collected in full and on due date, prior information of customers' creditworthiness should be available. This information can be gathered from various sources. Collecting credit information involves cost and time, so these factors should be considered when choosing the process. Sources of credit information include:

- **Financial Statements**: Profit and loss account and balance sheet of the customer's firm provide insights into financial soundness. Useful ratios: Current ratio, acid test ratio, debt-equity ratio, EBIT to total assets ratio, return on equity.
- **Bank References**: A customer's bank account is a valuable source of information regarding their creditworthiness. Bank references can be obtained directly or by requesting the customer to instruct their bank to provide the same.
- **Trade References**: Prospective customers can provide trade references from firms they currently deal with.
- **Other Sources**: Information can also be obtained from credit rating agencies (CRISIL, ICRA, CARE) and trade and industry associations.

### Credit Investigation

Once credit information is gathered, it needs to be analyzed to isolate matters requiring further investigation. Factors affecting the extent and nature of credit investigation include:

- Type of customer (new or existing)
- Customer’s business line, background, and trade risks
- Nature of products (perishable or seasonal)
- Size of the customer’s order and expected business volume
- Company’s credit policies and practices

Key aspects to investigate:
- **Capacity**: Ability of the buyer to pay on time.
- **Character**: Willingness of the buyer to pay, judged by past payment records.
- **Collateral**: Security against the credit granted.
- **Conditions**: Sensitivity of the buyer to the general economic environment.

### Analysis of Credit File

A credit file compiles all relevant credit information of the customer. For new customers, information should be thoroughly analyzed; for existing customers, the credit file should be analyzed when extending credit for larger accounts or longer periods. Financial ratios, business analysis, and management quality should also be evaluated.

### Credit Limit

A credit limit is the maximum amount of credit a firm will extend at a point of time, indicating the risk taken by supplying goods on credit. The amount and duration of credit depend on the customer’s financial strength.

### Collection Policy

Proper management of receivables requires an appropriate collection policy to outline collection procedures. The objective is to minimize the average collection period and bad debt losses. An optimum collection policy balances collection expenditure and potential sales impact.

## Monitoring Receivables

Continuous monitoring and control of receivables ensure dues are paid on time. Methods used:

1. **Average Collection Period (ACP)**: Defined as: 
   ```
   ACP = (Debtors*365)/Credit Sales
   ```

   Comparing ACP with the stated credit period helps judge collection efficiency. Drawbacks: It gives an average picture and is susceptible to sales variation.

2. **Aging Schedule**: Classifies outstanding accounts receivable into different age brackets. If a greater proportion of receivables are in higher age schedules, corrective actions are needed.

## Factoring

Factoring involves assigning credit management and collection to specialist organizations. Factoring provides financial and management support by purchasing receivables. Types of factoring services:

- Sales ledger administration and credit management
- Credit collection and protection against default and bad debt losses
- Financial accommodation against book debts

Additional services:
- Information about prospective buyers
- Financial counseling
- Assistance in liquidity management and sickness prevention
- Financing acquisition of inventories
- Assistance for opening letters of credit

### Types of Factoring

1. **Full Service Non Recourse**: Factor assumes 100% credit risk.
2. **Full Service Recourse Factoring**: Client bears the risk of debtor default.
3. **Bulk Agency Factoring**: Used mainly for financing book debts.
4. **Non Notification Factoring**: Customers are not informed about the factoring agreement.

### Costs and Benefits of Factoring

Costs:
- Factoring commission or service fee
- Interest on advances granted by the factor

Benefits:
- Specialized credit management service
- Savings on credit administration costs due to economies of scale

## Non-Performing Assets (NPAs)

NPAs are loans and advances in default or arrears. An asset becomes non-performing when it stops generating income for the bank. Classification:

- **Substandard Asset**: NPA for less than 12 months.
- **Doubtful Asset**: NPA for more than 12 months.
- **Loss Assets**: Loans needing to be fully written off.

### Provisions for NPAs

Banks set aside amounts from profits as provisions for NPAs. Metrics to understand NPA situation:
- **GNPA**: Gross non-performing assets.
- **NNPA**: Net non-performing assets (GNPA minus provisions).

### Reasons for Growing NPAs

Internal factors:
- Misuse of borrowed funds
- Defective lending process
- Inappropriate technology
- Poor credit appraisal system
- Managerial deficiencies
- Lack of regular follow-up
- Faulty documentation

External factors:
- Ineffective recovery tribunals
- Willful defaults
- Natural calamities
- Lack of demand
- Growth of sick industries
- Relaxed lending norms

### Suggestions to Reduce NPAs

In order to reduce the NPAs, the following suggestions are very useful. Let us discuss them in brief.

#### Proper Monitoring
- **Proper monitoring of end use of money by banks is essential**, especially in case of large value advances to detect the diversion of funds.
- **Diversion of Funds**: According to RBI, diversion of funds refers to using the borrowed funds for purposes other than the purpose for which the loan was sanctioned.

#### Strong Legal Actions Against Defaulters
- **RBI and Government Realization**: The RBI and the government realized that there should be strong legal actions against the willful defaulters.
- **Criminal Actions and Penalties**: On January 28, the RBI set up the working group to recommend appropriate measures, including criminal action and penalties, against the default borrowers who have intentionally diverted the borrowed funds.

#### Removal of Political Intervention
- **Political Intervention**: The finance ministry interferes in the selection of a chairman, directors, and managing directors of the bank.
- **Autonomy to Bank Boards**: This can be removed by giving autonomy to the boards of the banks. The RBI is also under political interference today.
- **Sectoral Preferences**: Banks should be permitted to choose the sectors they wish to offer financial assistance to. For example, foreign banks concentrate on export credit rather than agriculture.

#### Strong Follow-Up Supervision
- **Regular Institutional Visits**: NPA has not occurred overnight and therefore, will require regular institutional visits.
- **Field Visits**: A technical team must be formed for field visits. Physical verification of progress achieved by the assisted unit helps to monitor the end use of funds and regular recovery of loans.

### NPAs Recovery Mechanism

The Government of India has taken various measures and initiatives to recover the amount blocked in NPAs. Let us discuss those measures/initiatives in detail.

#### Lok Adalat
- **Alternative Dispute Redressal Mechanism**: Established by the government itself, it remains one of the preferred “alternative dispute redressal mechanisms.”
- **Amicable Settlement**: A physical platform where pending legal cases of the court of law or at pre-litigation stage get amicably settled.
- **Statutory Grade**: The decisions or verdicts of Lok Adalats are equated with court decrees given by the civil courts.
- **Finality**: Verdicts are compulsively decisive and must be acted upon by the involved parties. They can’t be appealed further before any court of law.

#### Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT)
- **Speedy Redressal**: Aimed at speedy redressal of matters related to banks on NPAs.
- **Formation**: Formed by virtue of the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (RDDBFI Act).
- **Resolution Facilitation**: Facilitates fast resolution between financiers and debtors by filing Original Applications (OAs) in DRTs and appeals to Debts Recovery Appellate Tribunals (DRATs).

#### SARFAESI Act
- **Purpose**: To reform banking systems and supportive legal structures for debt recovery.
- **Empowerment of Banks**: Enables banks and related financial institutions to recover assets by taking possession of securities and selling them to reduce NPA burden.
- **Techniques for Recovery**:
  - **Securitization**: Financial assets are acquired and security receipts offered to qualified institutional buyers.
  - **Asset Reconstruction**: ARCs buy NPAs from banks and attempt to recover bad loans within the legal framework.
  - **Enforcement of Security**: Under Section 13 of SARFAESI Act, banks can enforce security interests without court intervention.

#### Bankruptcy Code
- **Introduction**: The Insolvency and Bankruptcy (IBC) Code Bill introduced in 2015, came into force in 2016.
- **Forum Consolidation**: Reduced the burden on Supreme Court, BIFR, DRT, and CLB by bringing matters to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).
- **Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India**: Enforces the IBC code through legal amendments for reorganization and insolvency resolution.
- **Insolvency Resolution Process (IRP)**: A debtor can initiate the IRP, starting a 180-day period for creditors' claims to be processed. If 75% of economic creditors agree on a revival plan within this period, the process continues; otherwise, the firm is referred for liquidation.
