# Cash Management and Treasury Management

## Overview
- Cash management, also known as treasury management in corporate settings.
- Key individuals: Business managers, corporate treasurers, and chief financial officers.
- Involves collecting and managing cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities.
- Importance: Ensures smooth business operations, avoids negative impacts of too much or too little cash.

## Facets of Cash Management
- Cash is significant yet unproductive; used to pay obligations.
- Aim: Maintain adequate control over cash position and use excess cash profitably.
- Management of:
  - Cash inflows and outflows.
  - Cash flows within the firm.
  - Cash balances (financing deficits and investing surplus).

### Cash Management Cycle
- Sales generate cash, used for operating activities.
- Surplus cash: Invest.
- Deficit: Borrow.
- Objectives: Minimize costs, achieve liquidity, and maintain control.

### Strategies for Cash Management
- **Cash Planning**: Estimate cash inflows and outflows, project cash surplus or deficit, prepare a cash budget.
- **Managing Cash Flows**: Accelerate inflows, delay outflows.
- **Optimum Cash Level**: Balance cost of excess cash vs. cash deficiency.
- **Investing Surplus Cash & Financing Deficit**: Invest in short-term instruments and plan sources for financing deficits.

### Motives for Holding Cash
- **Transaction Motive**: Meet ordinary business payments (purchases, wages, taxes, etc.).
- **Precautionary Motive**: Meet uncertainties and emergencies, influenced by cash flow predictability and borrowing ability.
- **Speculative Motive**: Invest in profit-making opportunities.

### Cash Planning
- Ensure smooth operations, avoid cash deficit or surplus.
- **Cash Forecasting and Budgeting**: Plan and control cash receipts and payments.
  - Consider credit periods, payment schedules, minimum cash balance, and non-cash transactions.
- **Optimum Cash Balance**: Maintain enough cash to meet obligations without holding excess.

### Baumol's Model for Optimum Cash Balance
- Treats cash management as similar to inventory management.
- Aim: Minimize total cost (holding cost + transaction cost).
- Assumptions: Predictable cash needs, known opportunity cost, constant transaction cost.
- Calculation:

### Example Calculation
- **Given**: Total cash requirement = Rs. 20 million, opportunity cost = 15%, transaction cost = Rs. 150.
