## Concepts to be observed at the recording stage
1. **Business Entity Concept**:
   - The concept of business entity assumes that business has a distinct and separate entity from its owners.
   - It means that for the purposes of accounting, the business and its owners are to be treated two separate entities.
   - When a person brings in some money as capital into his business, in a/c records, it is treated as liability of the business to the owner.
   - Accounting is done according to the company not according to owner.

2. **Money Measurement Concept**
   - The concept of money measurement states that only thpse transactions and happenings in an organization which can be expressed in terms of moneu such as sale of goods or payment of expense or receipt of income etc are to be recorded in the book of account.

5. **Cost Concept**
   - The cost concept requires that all assets are recorded in the book of accounts at their purchase price, which inckudes cost of acquisition, transportation, installation and making the asset ready to use.
   - The concept of cost is historical in nature as it is something, which has been paid on the date of acquisition and does not change year after year.
   - for example: if a building has been purchased by a firm of Rs. 2.5 crore, the purchase price will remai the same for all years to come, though its market value may change.

6. **Dual Aspect Concept**
   - It is the foundation of basic principle of accounting. It provides the very basis for recording business transactions into the book of accounts.
   - This concept states that every transaction hs a dual or two fold effect and should therefore be recorded at two places. 
   - In other words, at least two accounts will be involved in recording a transaction.

    `Assets = Liabilities + Capital`
    - Mr. XY initiated his business with INR 1,00,000 cash, which formed the asset to the business. Business entity concept says that the business and the owner are two separate entities thus Mr. XY contribution of one lakh should be treated as the business liability. So Capital = Assets Rs. 1,00,000 = Rs. 1,00,000 (cash) 

7. **Accrual Concept**

   - **Definition**:

       1. **Before the Right to Receive Arises**:
          - Cash receipt will not be recognized as revenue since the right to receive it has not yet arisen.
       2. **After the Right to Receive Arises**:
          - Revenue is recognized even if the cash is received in a subsequent period.

   - **Expense Recognition**:
     - **Advance Payments**:
       - Should not be accounted for as an expense if they do not belong to the accounting period in question.
       - The entity receiving advance payments is treated as a debtor until the due date of payment arrives.

       - Must be recorded as expenses.
       - The person to whom the payment should have been made is shown as a creditor.

## Accounting Standards

By now, we understand that the rules, conventions, and concepts in accounting form its basic structure. There is an overlap and coexistence of these concepts. For a coherent approach involving best practices followed internationally, a standardized method is necessary.
