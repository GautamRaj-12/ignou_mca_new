## Trial Balance

- **Definition**:
  - A statement showing debit and credit balances for each account.
  - Prepared after posting accounts in the ledger and finding each account's balance.
  - Lists each account and enters their balances into separate debit and credit columns.
  - Totals of debit and credit columns must be equal, indicating no arithmetical errors.
  - Under Double Entry System, total debit side equals total credit side.
  - Ensures reasonable confidence in accounting accuracy, though not proof of cent per cent accuracy.

- **Undetectable Errors**:
  - **Error of complete omission**: Transaction not entered into the system.
  - **Error of original entry**: Wrong amounts on both sides of a double-entry transaction.
  - **Error of reversal**: Correct amounts but debited and credited accounts reversed.
  - **Error of principle**: Transaction violates fundamental accounting principles (e.g., wrong account type).
  - **Error of commission**: Correct amount but wrong account debited or credited due to oversight.
