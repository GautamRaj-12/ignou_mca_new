## Approaches to Artificial Intelligence

To evaluate AI's human-likeness, several approaches are used:

- **Turing Test**:
  - Proposed by Alan Turing in 1950.
  - Measures AI's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a human.
  - Criticized by John Searle's Chinese Room Test, which argues that mimicking understanding does not equate to actual understanding.
